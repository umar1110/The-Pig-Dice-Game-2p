        Game Rules:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
        <li>- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
        </li>
        <li>- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
        <li>- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
        <li>- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game</li>
    </ul>
